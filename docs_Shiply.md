## Description

This is our major project called SHIPLY. It is a postal office app with real-time data, responsive and well-built for ideal user experience. Gracefully tested and deployed on platforms, we followed project specsifications smoothly.

## Project Overview

Shiply is an app which includes three major milestones - Client app, Driver app and a simulation of a parcel locker. They are all connected not only in UI, but also tighten up with database functionality.

## Our team

##### Our team is our pride! Get to know the talented individuals who brought this project to life.

### Rachna Kumar

Rachna has proven to be a motivated and responsible team player. She takes charge of frontend development and app design of main client app, ensuring a seamless user experience. Rachna implemented all frontend architecture and layout.

### Hakan Asmaolgu

As the mastermind behind Figma design, styling, and layout, Hakan is ensuring smooth design for all our apps: client, driver and parcels app. His responsibilities also include frontend development of main client app. Also, Hakan has been  dividing tasks and organising our work into more connected to each other.

### Shovan Das

Shovan is developing the driver app and locker app. His expertise extends to full-stack implementation for both applications. Shovan takes charge of MySQL driver and lockers responsibilities, ensuring smooth connectivity for drivers, lockers, and clients. 

Shovan has also enhanced client app to make it more responsive and introduced new tech stack into our frontend.

### Mariia Glushenkova

## Project Components

Our apps are following same architecture and structure. Our main app "Shiply-app" is the brain of all our apps. It consists of client frontend and backend for all apps.

Other apps like driver ap and touchscreen app are frontend-based, sendind requests to our backend.

1. **Application Architecture**
   
   - Application architecture is following default React application principles on frontend and backend is structured as per database tables: driver endpoints, parcels endpoints, client endpoints, location endpoints etc.
   - 

2. **Database Structure**
   
   - For all our apps, we use hosted Amazon RDS database MySQL.
     
     Here is our diagram with all important tables and key properties.
     
     ![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-12-05-15-50-49-image.png)
     
     As per model, Parcels table is the one which connects other tables. It has key-to-key relationship with Client and Driver tables. Locatioins and cabinets table are created for handling different location of parcel cetners.

3. **Interface Description**
   
   - Interface is lightweight and powerful. There are different sections of websites to send, track, receive and look at history. 
   - For driver app there are all possible packages and possibility to tak them to parcel locker
   - Parcel locker is simulating aka Posti lokers for sending, receiving packages.

4. **UI Plan**
   
   - Our UI is made with Figma design, here is the link for main client app design
     https://www.figma.com/proto/jijAvzmo9h8uR9TxKqVhCe/Shiply-Main-Design?type=design&node-id=396-3280&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=15%3A4 (Click to go to touchscreen to see parcel simulator)
   - Click "Log in as driver" to see driver app

   #### Robot app
   
   ¬∑ Application to automatically generate new parcel deliveries to consumer users. This is a backend application only. This is the parcel generator ‚Äúrobot‚Äù.
   
   Deployed in a file robot.ts  in the backend folder.
